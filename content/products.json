    "description": "Vital for more than 300 biochemical reactions, magnesium is indispensable to our bodies. Insufficient magnesium levels can trigger migraines, sleep disturbances, fatigue, leg cramps, and muscle soreness. Opting for skin absorption bypasses digestive issues and increases absorption levels. Overall, magnesium is involved in a wide range of physiological processes and is essential for overall health and well-being. Maintaining adequate magnesium levels through diet and supplementation is important for supporting optimal body function.",
